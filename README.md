# Web Project Starter

Pitch to web team as boilerplate for web projects (LAMP stack) not requiring a specific framework.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, open a terminal instance, clone the repo, install dependencies via [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer), and start the PHP development server.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/wheatbrad/web-starter.git
$ composer install
$ composer serve
```
Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8881`.
